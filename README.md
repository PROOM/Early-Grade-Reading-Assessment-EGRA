# Early-Grade-Reading-Assessment-EGRA

Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) are low-stakes tests conducted among children to gauge how they can read. EGRA has several sub-tasks and the toolkit with all the sub-tasks can be found here:https://shared.rti.org/content/early-grade-reading-assessment-egra-toolkit-second-edition

For this EGRA aasessment, I picked this sub-tasks: Listening Comprehension, Letter Identification, Word Identification, Pseudo Words Identiication and Reading Comprehension. Some tasks are timed and the child has to read within 30 seconds or sixty seconds.

Basic data analysis must include Gender and Locality. ANOVA and regressions can also be perfomed given the dependent variables are continous.
